            <h4>1st Post</h4>
            <p>With the first two weeks of classes now come and gone it seems time to evaluate these new surroundings.  The whole experience is still fresh enough that I continue to need my morning reminders about class that same evening.  All in due time though waiting for routine to take hold.  As for the class, the material is, so far, a step above review from the pre-work but that is to be expected as we get a feel for our instructors and peers and vice versa.  Soon enough, I'm sure, I will be flailing for any apparatus to keep my head above water and I feel very grateful this panic has yet to rear it's head.  We walked through a fairly simple example of using HTML &amp; CSS together as a class and even though the concepts weren't new to me it was extremely helpful to watch Zoe plan her work in to manageable steps before ever writing the first line of code.  This has already proven to be vital information as we have begun to create pages on our own.  70% planning 25% writing 5% talking to my rubber duck while fighting back tears in the shower, the last two percentages will wax and wane I'm told.  I really couldn't be more excited about this class though, the instructors are everything positive I could have hoped for, my peers are helpful, inquisitive, and motivated.</p>
